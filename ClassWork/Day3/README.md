#  Day 3 – Java Problem Solving

This folder contains solutions to problems I solved on **Day 3** of my Java practice journey.  
The focus of this day was **matrix traversal and stack-based problems**.

##  Problems Solved

| Problem | File | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Convert 1D to 2D | [Convert_1D_to_2D.java](./Convert_1D_to_2D.java) | Convert a 1D array into a 2D matrix with given dimensions. |
| Flipping Image | [FlippingImage.java](./FlippingImage.java) | Flip a binary image horizontally and then invert it. |
| Lucky Number in a Matrix | [Lucky_number_In_a_Matrix.java](./Lucky_number_In_a_Matrix.java) | Find numbers that are the minimum in their row and maximum in their column. |
| Search in 2D Matrix | [Search_In_2D_matrix.java](./Search_In_2D_matrix.java) | Use binary search to find an element in a sorted 2D matrix. |
| Largest Rectangle in Histogram | [largest_rectangle_in_histogram.java](./largest_rectangle_in_histogram.java) | Find the largest rectangular area in a histogram using stacks. |
| Maximal Rectangle | [maximal_rectangle.java](./maximal_rectangle.java) | Find the largest rectangle of 1’s in a binary matrix (extension of histogram problem). |
| Spiral Matrix | [spiralMatrix.java](./spiralMatrix.java) | Return all elements of a matrix in spiral order. |

##  Language Used
- **Java** (all implementations)

---

##  Learnings

- Practiced **matrix traversal techniques** (spiral order, flipping, binary search in 2D).  
- Learned **stack-based approaches** for problems like *Largest Rectangle in Histogram* and applied it to *Maximal Rectangle*.  
- Strengthened problem-solving in **dynamic 2D scenarios** by reducing matrix problems to simpler 1D or histogram-based solutions.  
- Improved at recognizing **problem transformations** (matrix → histogram → stack solution).
